## Folder Structure

```plaintext
src/

## Customization

### 1. **Update Content**
- Modify `src/pages/Home.jsx` to update the homepage content.

### 2. **Styling**
- Update `tailwind.config.js` for custom colors, fonts, or themes.
- Use Tailwind utility classes directly in your components.

### 3. **Animations**
- Customize animations by editing Framer Motion props (e.g., `initial`, `animate`, `transition`).
- Check out the examples in `src/pages/Home.jsx`.
